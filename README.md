# Vending Machine

Welcome to the Vending Machine Application repository! This project implements an application for a vending machine distributor. Customers can purchase food items from the vending machine and are charged accordingly.

## Features

- The vending machine dispenses munchies, candy, drinks, and gum.
- Customers can view the available items and their quantities.
- Customers can purchase items by feeding money into the machine and selecting the desired item.
- After a successful purchase, the item is dispensed to the customer, and the machine's balance is updated.
- A BOGODO (Buy One, Get One Dollar Off) sale is applied for eligible items.
- Customers can complete the transaction, receive any remaining change, and return to the main menu.
- All purchases are audited and logged in an `Audit.txt` file to prevent theft.
